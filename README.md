# Periodic table

## Case
As I am constantly developing some projects, I randomly found the idea of making an interactive periodic table and I started implementing it immediately. I found it really interesting and it did not seem difficult to build. Here is my interpretation of interactive table of chemical elements.

## How to set up the project locally:
1. Clone the repository locally:
```
git clone https://github.com/JordanRad/periodic-table.git
```
2. Open the folder with the project:
```
cd periodic-table
```
3. Install npm in the folder:
```
npm install
```
4. Start the project:
```
npm start
```
And wait until it loads on localhost:3000
